# Compress and Eliminate solver

This is a Fortran and Python implementation of the [Compress and Eliminate](https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.09133v2) (CE) factorization. It is an approximate sparse triangular factorization for the symmetric positive definite (SPD) matrices that can be used either as a low-accuracy solver or as a preconditioner.

## Installation
Refer to the INSTALL.md file

## Requirenments
Compiling Fortan libs?
F2Py or ctypes?

The minimum requirements for CE Solver is:
* [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
* [SciPy](https://www.scipy.org/)
* [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/)

## Quick Start

You can find Jupyter notebook with examples in folder "examples".
